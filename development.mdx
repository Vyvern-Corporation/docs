Use this guide when you want to run the backend locally for testing or development.

## Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with the variables you need for your workflow.

Start with these values for auth:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=replace-me
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Add optional settings only when you use those features:

- `API_URL` for OAuth callback URLs.
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_TOKEN` for logo uploads.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_API_KEY` for AI and embeddings.
- `MCP_CREDENTIALS_KEY` and `MCP_CREDENTIALS_FILE` for MCP credentials.

## Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server listens on `PORT` if set, otherwise `5000`.

## Verify the server

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/
```

You should receive a JSON response with `message: "Vyvern API Server"`.
