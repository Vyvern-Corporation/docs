Use this guide to onboard employees and manage their accounts.

## Invite employees

Call `POST /api/employees` to create an employee and send an invitation email. The response includes an `inviteUrl` you can share manually.

Use `POST /api/employees/bulk` to create many employees in one request.

## Verify and complete setup

Employees follow the invite link and complete setup through the frontend. If you build your own flow, call these endpoints directly:

- `GET /api/employees/verify-token/:token`
- `POST /api/employees/setup`

`POST /api/employees/setup` requires a password and a `consentData` object.

## Employee login

Employees authenticate using `POST /api/employees/login`. This returns an employee JWT you can use for employee-only routes.

## Manage employee records

Use these admin endpoints to manage employees:

- `GET /api/employees` to list employees for the current org.
- `PATCH /api/employees/:id` to update profile fields.
- `PATCH /api/employees/:id/status` to update only the status.
- `POST /api/employees/:id/resend-invitation` to resend an invite.

## Reset passwords

Employees can use the self-service reset flow:

- `POST /api/employees/forgot-password`
- `GET /api/employees/verify-reset-token/:token`
- `POST /api/employees/reset-password`

You can also reset a password as an admin using `PATCH /api/admin/employees/:id/reset-password`.
