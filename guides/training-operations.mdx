Use this guide to assign training and track progress.

## Create training content

Call `POST /api/training/content` to create a training module.

Include `contentId`, `title`, `category`, `contentType`, and `contentData`.

## Assign training

There are two assignment flows:

- `POST /api/training/records` for direct assignment.
- `POST /api/training/assign-from-failure` to assign training after a workflow failure.

## Track progress

Use `PUT /api/training/records/:id` to update progress, score, and completion data.

## Get recommendations

Call `GET /api/training/recommendations/:employeeId` to get recommendations for an employee. Pass `organizationId` as a query parameter.

## Update overdue training

Call `POST /api/training/update-overdue` to mark overdue records. This endpoint is useful in cron jobs.
