Use this guide to connect third-party services to an organization.

## Supported platforms

The backend supports these `platform` values:

- `gmail`
- `drive`
- `calendar`
- `outlook`
- `teams`
- `onedrive`
- `slack`

## Start the OAuth flow

Call `GET /api/oauth/:platform/authorize` with `organizationId` to receive an `authUrl`.

Redirect the user to that URL to complete the provider consent flow.

## Handle the callback

The backend handles `GET /api/oauth/:platform/callback` automatically. The callback:

- Exchanges the code for tokens.
- Fetches the provider user profile.
- Stores the integration for the organization.
- Redirects to `FRONTEND_URL` with success or error parameters.

## List integrations

Call `GET /api/oauth/integrations?organizationId=...` to fetch integrations for an organization.

## Disconnect integrations

Call `DELETE /api/oauth/:platform/disconnect` with `organizationId` in the body.
