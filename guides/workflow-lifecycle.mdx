Use this guide to work with workflows and proposals.

## Create a proposal

There are two common paths:

- `POST /api/workflows` to create a workflow proposal directly.
- `POST /api/workflows/generate-proposal` to request an AI-generated proposal.

Both paths create workflows in `DRAFT` status.

## Review and approve

Approve or reject proposals:

- `POST /api/workflows/:id/approve`
- `POST /api/workflows/:id/reject`

If you approve with `autoStart: true`, the workflow moves to `ACTIVE` and starts executing.

## Execute and manage

Use these endpoints to control execution:

- `POST /api/workflows/:id/start` to start an `APPROVED` workflow.
- `POST /api/workflows/:id/pause` to pause an `ACTIVE` workflow.
- `POST /api/workflows/:id/resume` to resume a `PAUSED` workflow.

## Monitor status

Call `GET /api/workflows` to list workflows and filter by status, type, or priority.

Call `GET /api/workflows/stats/summary` to get totals by status for the organization.

## Delete drafts

You can only delete workflows in `DRAFT` status using `DELETE /api/workflows/:id`.
