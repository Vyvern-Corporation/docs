This section documents Vyvern's backend server API ("SAPI") routes and middleware.

Use these pages for the authoritative request and response shapes for the API used by the Vyvern frontend and internal tooling.

## Quick start

- Start at [Backend API overview](backend/overview) for base URL, auth, and shared behavior.
- Review [Middleware](backend/middleware) to understand auth and org scoping.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require a bearer token.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

If you need employee-only access, use employee tokens from `POST /api/employees/login` or `POST /api/employees/setup`.

## Organization scoping

Some routes accept `X-Organization-Id` to select a specific org.

```
X-Organization-Id: <organization-id>
```
